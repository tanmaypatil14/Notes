When you are using an interface to declare an lambda expression that interface should have only one method and that method should be
same method signature.
If we created more than one method mdg we get -> 'The target type of this expression must be a functional interface'.

What is anonymous inner class?
The class which is defined inside another class and it doesn't have a name, this is called as anonymous inner class.

public class Greeter {
	public static void main(String[] args) {

		Greeting greeting = () -> System.out.println("Hello World...!"); 
		greeting.perform();

                Greeting getHelloWorldGreeting = new Greeting() {
                      public void perform() {
                          System.out.println("Hello World..!");
                      }
                };
                getHelloWorldGreeting.perform();
	}

}
